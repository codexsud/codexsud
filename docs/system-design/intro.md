# System Design

System Design is the process of defining the architecture, components, and data flow of a system to meet business and technical requirements.

### **HLD vs. LLD**  

| Aspect          | High-Level Design (HLD)  | Low-Level Design (LLD)  |
|---------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| **Focus**      | Overall system structure | Detailed component design |
| **Audience**  | Architects, stakeholders  | Developers, engineers |
| **Granularity** | Broad, conceptual       | Specific, technical |
| **Output**    | Diagrams, architecture docs | Class diagrams, pseudocode |

Both HLD and LLD are **crucial for building scalable and efficient systems**. One provides direction, the other ensures precision.
