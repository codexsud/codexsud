# ðŸš€ High-Level Design (HLD)

High-Level Design (HLD) is the **big-picture blueprint** of a system, outlining its structure and key components before moving into detailed development.  

### **What HLD Covers:**  
- **Main Parts:** Key components and how they connect.  
- **Data Flow:** How information moves between parts.  
- **Tech Stack:** What tools and platforms are used.  
- **Scalability:** How the system can grow over time.  

HLD helps teams stay aligned and ensures a solid foundation before diving into the finer details of implementation.
